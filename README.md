Training Material

In this repository I have posted all of the training material for a week long tutorial given to students in both Johannesburg and then again in Cape Town South Africa.

With the advnet of the Arduino board and its subsequent popularity, many companies tried to jump onto that bandwagon.  And Intel Corporation was no exception.  Though several of us had tried for many years to get Intel to go down this path, interest did not arise until success was first realized by a competing architecture.  So Intel pulled together a team of CPU architects in Ireland and spun thier own version of an embedded CPU.  This was the Edison Processor.

Because of my noted previous success in teaching hundreds of students about the Arduino platform, I was recruited to join a team tasked with developing training material for the Edison Processor and it's associated board, Galileo.  We pretty much copied everything over from my Arduino training materials and a couple of great coders from Ireland added some really cool "connected" capabilites to the material.

The lessons are marked in order ... and there are five of them.  Just puruse through from Lesson 1 to 5 and you should be O.K.  I hope you find value in the content.

You can get access to my original Arduino materials [here](https://github.com/the-john/MyQUAD).
